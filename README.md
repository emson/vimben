#VimBen

My personal Vim installation, which is basically a customised fork of the [Janus Project](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/).

## Installation

To install VimBen, please use our [automatic
installer](https://github.com/emson/vimben/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)
, which backups up any Vim files found in your home folder and installs
VimBen.

```bash
$ curl -Lo- https://raw.github.com/emson/vimben/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
